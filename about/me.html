                    Hello, my name is Stefan, and I define myself as an all-around information seeker. 
                    I believe that <i>'The things you can learn are unlimited, but the time you have is limited'</i>.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2><i>What do you do?</i></h2>
                <p>
                    <p>I'm currently enrolled in a Higher National Certificate <b>(HNC)</b> program in Web Development in Spain.</p>
                    <p>Apart from this curriculum, I'm self-learning other vital skills like touch typing (mecanography) 
                    to enhance efficiency, or delving into customizing Linux from scratch.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, I'm challenging myself to master <b>Vim</b> as an efficient Integrated Development Environment <b>(IDE)</b>.</p> 
                    <p>In essence, I strive daily to better myself, aiming to improve atleast <b>1%</b> compared to yesterday.</p>
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2> <i>Apart from web development, what other interests do you have?</i></h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, I want to specialize in <b>Cybersecurity</b> because 
                    I find that world very interesting and concerning due to the vulnerabilities in the internet.
